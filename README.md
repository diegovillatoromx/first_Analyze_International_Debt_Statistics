# Analyze International Debt Statistics project by Diego Villatoro

## Project Overview
In the realm of data engineering, our focus extends beyond personal financial obligations, encompassing the intricate fiscal landscape of nations. Just as individuals seek loans to manage necessities, countries also engage in debt strategies to navigate their economies. Take, for instance, the substantial investment required for bolstering infrastructure, a vital facet in ensuring the well-being of a nation's populace. Facilitating this financial dynamic is The World Bank, the eminent institution extending fiscal support to nations.

Within this project's ambit lies the analysis of an extensive repository of international debt data, meticulously curated by The World Bank. This dataset encapsulates a comprehensive breakdown of debt amounts (denominated in USD) owed by developing countries, stratified across diverse categories. Your task entails unraveling key insights, addressing queries such as:

1. What constitutes the aggregate quantum of debt held by the nations enumerated within the dataset?
2. Which sovereign entity claims the preeminent share of debt, and to what magnitude does this figure ascend?
3. How does the mean debt quantum vary amongst countries, juxtaposed against distinct debt indicators?

## Dataset Used

The foundation of this analysis is constructed upon data sourced from The World Bank, encompassing both national and regional debt metrics spanning numerous countries globally. The temporal scope spans from 1970 to 2015, providing a comprehensive temporal panorama for our investigation.
